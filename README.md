My projects for [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

This suite of projects consists of building a computer platform from simple logic gates -- projects 1-5 entail building the hardware platform using a simple HDL, and projects 6-12 contain projects that build a software hierarchy on top of this hardware platform.
