My projects for [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), a MOOC which walks through building a general-purpose computing platform, and a software hierarchy on top of it.
Projects 1-5 contain the hardware portion, where I used logic gates to make a computer called Hack with a simple HDL.
The remaining projects 6-12 contain Python code for an assembler and compiler for a simple language called Jack, as well as an operating system made using Jack.
